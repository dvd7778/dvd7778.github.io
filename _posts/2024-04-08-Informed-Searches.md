This assginment consists of solving problem 4.4 from the Russel and Norvig's Artificiall Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd edition textbook, with a variety of informed search algorithms. It involves solving the 8-puzzle and 8-queens problems with the following search algorithms:\
&emsp; • Hill Climbing Steepest-Ascent\
&emsp; • Hill Climbing First-Choice\
&emsp; • Hill Climbing with Random Restarts\
&emsp; • Simulated Annealing

The repository with the code and how to run it can be found [here](https://github.com/dvd7778/Informed-Search-Algorithms).

The formal report analyzing the results and drawing conclusions from this assignment can be viewed below.
