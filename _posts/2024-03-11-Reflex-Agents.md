This assginment consists of designing different reflex agents to solve a few problems when it comes to a vacuum environment. It is based on problems 2.8 and 2.11 of the Russel and Norvig's Artificiall Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd edition textbook. In summary, a simple reflex agent, a random reflex agent, and a reflex agent with state were designed and tested in different vacuum environments to compare performances and determine which one was the most efficient in different vacuum environments. The repository with the code and how to run it can be found [here](https://github.com/dvd7778/Reflex-Agents).
