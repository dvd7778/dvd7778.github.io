This assignment consists of realizing a series of experiments using Python arrays and Numpy arrays. Numpy is a fundamental package widely known for its scientific computing abilities that provides multidimensional array objects, and an assortment of routines for fast operation on arrays. The experiments are essentially carrying out the product of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional arrays using native Python arrays and Numpy arrays, and then comparing the performances of each product operation. The code or repository corresponding to this assignment is [here](https://github.com/dvd7778/Python-VS-Numpy-Arrays).

Additionally the report that analyzes the collected data and draws some conclusions of it can be read below.
