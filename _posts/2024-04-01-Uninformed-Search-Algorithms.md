This assginment consists of solving 2 problems from the Russel and Norvig's Artificiall Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd edition textbook, with a variety of uninformed search algorithms. Specifically, problems 3.7 and 3.9. The first problem consists of an environment plane with convex polygonal obstacles where there is a start position, and you need to reach the end goal. The second problem consists of a famous problem where there a three missionaries, three cannibals and a boat that can carry up to two people. The goal of this problem is to have everyone cross a river without there ever being more cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river. Some of the search algorithms used are:\
&emsp; • Breadth First Search\
&emsp; • Depth First Search\
&emsp; • Uniform Cost Search

The repository with the code and how to run it can be found [here](https://github.com/dvd7778/Uninformed-Search-Algorithms).
