I'm an undergraduate student in my 5th year of Computer Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez. Looking to expand my knowledge and broaden my software skills through academic or professional opportunities such as internships, COOPs and research. My goal is to become a Full-Stack Engineer in a big tech company such as Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft or Nvidia. However, throughout the years, I have developed an interest in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and would love to learn more about them. In my years at UPRM I've worked on projects in different languages and frameworks. I have primarily used Python; however, I also have experience in C, C++ and Java. Besides course projects, my experience consists of taking part in the Google Tech Exchange Program in 2023, working as a COOP student in MCS Healtcare Holdings in the Internet Technology Department in 2023, and becoming an upcoming Google Software Engineering Intern at YouTube for the summer of 2024. Apart from my professional experience, I have worked on a variety of course projects and assignments from the Data Structures, Database Systems, Microprocessors, Software Development Studio and Artificial Intelligence courses which can be seen in this Portfolio.
